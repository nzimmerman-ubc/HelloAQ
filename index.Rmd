Air pollution is an urgent problem linked to as many as nine million deaths per year worldwide and 14,000 annually in Canada, primarily from related heart and lung diseases. In Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), sources of air pollution include industrial emissions, vehicle emissions and wildfire smoke. 
The air pollutants of concern include Particulate Matter less than 2.5 µm in size (PM~2.5~), Ozone, Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~) and Nitrogen Oxides^1^. Breathing high concentrations of these pollutants can cause chronic illnesses, headaches, and even lung cancer and heart disease. 

On UBC campus, sources of air pollution include personal vehicles, construction, restaurants, and businesses. In fact, the BC Air Quality Health Index can change from “Low-Risk” to “High-Risk” on campus during air pollution events such as wildfires. 

![Figure 1. Sources of Air Pollution in Canada (https://www.ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report).](Sources_BC.png)

To address this, we have installed a network of 8 low-cost air quality sensors across UBC campus to measure air pollutant concentrations at different locations on campus. We are leveraging UBC’s existing 5G test bed that includes 1. anonymized video cameras (partnership with Numina^2^ and Blue City^3^) at traffic intersections to track vehicles, buses, pedestrians, and bicyclists; 2. Anonymized mobile data aggregation (partnership with Rogers Communication and Downtown.AI^4^) and 3. Survey Information (partnership with Hello Lamp Post^5^). 

Our low-cost air quality sensors are called “Remote Air Quality Monitoring Platform” (RAMPs). RAMPs are capable of measuring air pollutants such as PM~2.5~, CO, CO~2~, NO and NO~2~ every 15 seconds. RAMPs are solar-powered, battery-operated and can also measure wind speed and direction (with attachments).

# Reading the Map
Click on the individual sensors to read the respective pollutant concentrations across campus. The colour of the circle changes as the PM~2.5~ concentration increases. Breathing high concentrations of PM~2.5~ can lead to chronic illnesses including lung cancer and increased risk of heart attacks.
